## About The Project:
With the rise of betting sites I became curious of the logic that happens behind the scenes when bets are placed and won/lost, as a result, I created the Sketchy Bets application. Sketchy Bets is a web application that allows users to place bets on esports matches with mock money. Users must create an account before being able to make a bet and all bets are authenticated before they are placed. Once a bet is placed, the odds of the match are updated instantly updated and displayed to users. Currently, the backend of the Sketchy bets application is unavaliable, however, you can view how the application worked in the Showcase section down below.
